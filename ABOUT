Introduction
============================
This test framework is a QEMU bare metal test for validating ARM QEMU
features.  It was specifically designed to test QEMU TrustZone support not
fully verified by booting linux alone.

The test consists of multiple images that execute at varying exception levels
and execution modes.  Each image is built separately but share functionality
where feasible.  The images utilize the standard ARM SVC and SMC instructions
for communication between ELs.

The design philosophy behind this test is to provide a simple framework for
adding micro-functional tests that don't need the complexity of a full-fledged
HLOS (High Level Operating System) or TEE (Trusted Exeution Environment).

File structure and layout
============================
${ARCH} = Architecture for which the test is built. Currently, either "aarch64"
          or "arm" are supported.  This is declared during configure using the
          "--arch" option.

${PLAT} = Machine platform for which the test is built.  Currently, either
          "virt" or "vexpress-a15" are supported.  This is declared during
          configuration using the "--plat" option.

[non]secure = Refers to either the nonsecure (nsec) or secure (sec) path or
              file.

Design
============================

Images
----------------
The test consists of a single bios binary, named "tztest.img", that can be
supplied to QEMU through the "-bios" command line option.  The test image is
composed of the following images:

  * el3.bin       Binary image containing EL3 functionality and tests
  * el1_sec.bin   Binary image containing secure EL1 functionality and tests
  * el1_nsec.bin  Binary image containing nonsecure EL1 functionality and tests
  * el0_sec.elf   ELF image containing secure EL0 functionality and tests
  * el0_nsec.elf  ELF image containing nonsecure EL0 functionality and tests

The El3 and EL1 images include bootloaders for loading and initializing the
images. Execution of these images is initiated by transferring execution to
their known starting flash location.

The EL0 images are not self-loading and rely on their respective EL1
counterpart to load the image.  By using ELF format, the EL1 loader has the
necessary information for determining the location of each of the EL0 image
data as well as other information such as architecture.

Loading
----------------
All images are loaded into RAM and intialized prior to any tests being
performed.  The load order is as follows:

  EL3 --> EL1 (secure) --> EL0 (secure) --> EL1 (nonsecure) -> EL0 (nonsecure)

  During loading, the transition between levels is performed through targeted
  exception returns and SMC/SVC calls.  These are performed by using
  predetermined target addresses as defined in common/${ARCH}/memory.h.

Once all the images are loaded, test execution is initiated from the nonsecure
EL0 main entry point.

System Control
----------------
In order to allow common control and communication between each of the ELs, the
EL3 start-up code allocates and shares a common system control structure. The
physical address of this control structure is passed to each of the initiated
EL1 images through register 4.  It is the responsbility of each EL1 to map this
control strcture into its own address space.

The contents of the system control structure can be found in common/syscntl.h.
It includes the following:
  * Shared inter-operation buffer descriptor
  * Exception handler controls
  * Test control and status block

All common test framework controls shall reside in this structure.

Communication
----------------
Transitions and communication between exception levels is performed using
structured SMC/SVC calls  and exception return operations. Predefined
inter-operation codes and descriptors are in common/interop.h and are common
between SVC and SMC calls. The inter-operation descriptors contain the
parameters for performing the desired operation.

Communication between EL0 and EL1 use the SVC ARM instruction to pass an SVC
opcode along with the SVC operation descriptor.  This descriptor is a union of
the supported inter-operation descriptors. Descriptors originating in EL0 may be
directly accessed by EL1 of the same security state because of the address
space.

Similarly, communication between EL1 and EL3 use the SMC ARM instruction to
pass an SMC opcode along with the SMC operation descriptor.  Likewise, this
descriptor is a union of the supported inter-operation descriptors. Given that
EL3 is used for transitioning between security states, direct access to
descriptors originating in EL1 or EL0 is disallowed and inaccessible by EL3.
Instead, a dedicated inter-operation descriptor buffer is provided for copy-in
and copy-out between the EL1s and EL3.

The global name of this buffer is smc_interop_buf and details pertaining to it
can be found in the system control structure.  The details include the buffer
physical and virtual address so the communicating EL1s can map the buffer into
their address space for access.

Memory
============================
The MMU is enabled by default for EL3 and both EL1s.  Each MMU controls a
distinct address space.  The EL1 and EL0 within a given security state share an
address space where EL1's address space is made privileged where possible. The
layout and memory map for each EL can be found in common/${ARCH}/memory.h.
Currently, the memory management functionality is fairly primitive.

Currently, the test framework is limited to small page usage.  No large page or
section support has been added.  Their are 2 facilities for setting up the page
tables: 1) common/${ARCH}/init_util.S contains page table facilities for use
during EL initialization and 2) common/mmu_util.c contains page table
facilities for runtime use.  The functionality consists of physical and virtual
address allocation, mapping, and unmapping.  All allocations and mapping occur
at a page granularity for simplicty and no deallocation or page reclaiming is
provided.

Tests
============================
All tests reside in the tztest directory. Tests are driven from nonsecure EL0
and originate in tztest_start().  This function executes the array of test
entries found in tztest[].

Each test entry consists of a test function ID and function argument along with
the target EL and secure state.  Execution is routed to the appropriate
target for execution where the function ID is used to identify the test function
to be executed.  Each level is responsible for determining whether it should
execute the given test or forward it onto the proper owner.

Test facilities are provided for performing verification:
  - Exception control, status and checking
    The system control descriptor contains a common block for controlling
    exception reporting an handling as well as logging facilities for test
    feedback and checking
  - Register access macros
    Macros are provided for accessing registers and data and varying ELs and
    security states.  Currently, you have to know what EL you are calling from
    in order to use the macros.
  - EL traversal functionality
    Builtin functions are provided for issuing SVC/SMC calls as well as
    exception returns.
  - Test message facilities
    Test print message macros are provided to standardize the test output.
  - Global test status block
    The system control descriptor contains a common block for reporting test
    statistics and data.

Currently, the following tests are performed.  Refer to the actual tests for
more detail.
  - Interoperation verification
  - Secure and nonsecure EL0 validation of SMC behavior
  - Secure and nonsecure EL1 validation of SMC behavior
  - AArch32 EL3 validation of SMC behavior
  - Secure and nonsecure EL0 register access validation
  - Secure and nonsecure EL1 register access validation
  - AArch64 EL0 CPACR and WFx exception trap validation
  - AArch32 EL1 CPSR bit masking verification
  - AArch64 EL1 CPACR and WFx exception trap validation

To-Dos
============================
The amount of features that can be added to the test are endless, but the
following are a few items that should eventually be addressed.

- Add test flash offset variables that the makefile and memory.h can share.
  This eliminates the possibility of changing it in one place but not the
  other.
- Add nested EL3 exception support.  Monitor tests are executed from the SMC
  handler, so any tests that generate exceptions will require that the
  el3_smc_vect be updated to save minimal state.
- Clean-up and better structure the memory map.  Memory usage could be improved
  and better isolated among the test images.
- Check and fix stack frames to make sure they are calling convention
  compliant.
- Break out platform UART initialization into its own ASM function.
- Clean-up ${ARCH} specific ifdefs in the test code.
- Add test registration facility to simplify adding tests.  This would consist
  of each test environment registering its known tests rather than having to
  add them to a common static table.  This would minimize the number of files
  changed to add a single test.
- Create a common interface for accessing system registers and data.
- Get vexpress-a9 working.
- Add use of TTBR1
- Wire exit() to test framework shutdown.
